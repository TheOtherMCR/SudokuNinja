A fun project to solve Sudoku puzzles while learning how to use Git.

I am slowly developing a C# Forms Sudoku application for Windows. I am making it up as I go.
I started by creating a Sudoku .NET control which will provide the interface. 
The next step is to provide support for setting the initial puzzle to solve and save it to a file.
